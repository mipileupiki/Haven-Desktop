# Haven Desktop — ⚠️ PUBLIC BETA

**Private chat, reimagined for your desktop.**

> **This is a beta release.** Bugs are expected — your feedback is what makes it better.
> Please [open an issue](https://github.com/ancsemi/Haven-Desktop/issues) if something breaks or feels off. All reports are welcome.

Haven Desktop is a standalone Electron application that connects to any [Haven](https://github.com/ancsemi/Haven) server — with features that go beyond the browser.

> **⬡ You need a Haven server to use this app.**
> Haven Desktop is a client — it connects to a Haven server running on your (or a friend's) machine.
> If you don't have one yet, **[download Haven](https://github.com/ancsemi/Haven)** first and follow the [setup guide](https://github.com/ancsemi/Haven/blob/main/GUIDE.md).

## 🛠️ Building from Source

> **Most users don't need this.** Just download the installer above. This section is for developers who want to contribute or build locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- **npm** 9+
- **C++ Build Tools:**
  - **Windows:** Visual Studio Build Tools 2019+ with the "Desktop development with C++" workload
  - **Linux:** `build-essential`, `libpulse-dev`

### Quick Start (Windows — No Terminal)

1. Double-click **`Setup.bat`** — installs everything
2. Double-click **`Start Haven Desktop.bat`** — launches the app
3. Double-click **`Build Installer.bat`** — creates a distributable `.exe` in `dist/`

### Quick Start (Terminal)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ancsemi/Haven-Desktop.git
cd Haven-Desktop

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the native audio addon
npm run build:native

# Run in dev mode
npm run dev
```

### Build Installers Locally

```bash
# Windows (NSIS one-click installer)
npm run build:win

# Linux (AppImage + .deb)
npm run build:linux
```

Output goes to the `dist/` directory.

### Automated Builds (CI)

Push a version tag to build automatically via GitHub Actions:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

GitHub Actions builds the Windows `.exe` and Linux `.AppImage` / `.deb`, then publishes them as a GitHub Release. No local build tools required.

### How Per-App Audio Works

**Windows (WASAPI Process Loopback):**
The app uses the Windows 10 2004+ `ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync` API with `AUDIOCLIENT_ACTIVATION_TYPE_PROCESS_LOOPBACK` to capture audio exclusively from a target process. This is the same API Discord uses. The native addon runs in a background thread, captures 48 kHz float32 PCM, and streams it to the renderer via IPC.

**Linux (PulseAudio):**
The app creates a virtual null sink, moves the target application's audio stream to it, records from the sink's monitor, and loops the audio back to the default output so the user still hears it.

**In the Renderer:**
PCM data arrives via IPC → `AudioWorkletNode` processes it → `MediaStreamDestination` produces a `MediaStreamTrack` → the track replaces the system-loopback audio on the screen share `MediaStream`. Haven's existing `voice.js` requires **zero modifications**.

## � Feedback & Bug Reports

This is a **beta release** — your feedback directly shapes the app. If something doesn't work, looks wrong, or could be better:

1. **[Open an issue](https://github.com/ancsemi/Haven-Desktop/issues)** with as much detail as you can
2. Include your OS, Haven server version, and steps to reproduce

Every report helps. Thank you for testing.
